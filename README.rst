tls-stats
=========

This is a Chrome Extension which collects stats about your browsing (stored
entirely locally!) so that you know which websites aren't using TLS.

Right now the only thing it tracks is which hosts you make HTTP connections to,
some day in the future I'd love for it to also track which hosts have bad TLS
configurations (TLS 1.0, no-PFS, RC4, etc.).

The goal as that by collecting data on people's actual usage, they will be
better informed about which websites to complain to because they don't value our
privacy.
